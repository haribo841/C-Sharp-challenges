//You are given 2 out of 3 angles in a triangle, in degrees.
//Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either "acute", "right", or "obtuse" based on its degrees.
//An acute angle is less than 90 degrees.
//A right angle is exactly 90 degrees.
//An obtuse angle is greater than 90 degrees (but less than 180 degrees).
//For example: MissingAngle(11, 20) should return "obtuse", since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.
